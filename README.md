## Instructions

To play game load index.html in browser.  A timer will start to count as soon as you load the page.  It will reset when the reset button is pressed. You click on the square cards to reveal a symbol, trying to match two revealed symbols at a time.  There is a counter for the number of moves the player has taken.  As well as a star rating based on the number of moves it takes the player in order to win.  Once the player wins a popup message will appear with the number of matches, the number of moves, the star rating and the time it took the player to win.
